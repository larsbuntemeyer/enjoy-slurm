Welcome to enjoy-slurm's documentation!
=======================================

``enjoy-slurm`` is a naive python slurm control package for python. It does interact with Slurm exactly as any user would do, simply through the command line tools and arguments. That's why we call it naive. However, it should avoid having to rewrite some scripts required to submit and control many Slurm jobs on an HPC computer. This package is a successor of the retired `HPC scheduler package <https://github.com/larsbuntemeyer/hpc-scheduler>`_.
